# Crash's init.vim

This Neovim config is intended for C++ development.

I use Neovim on my phone via Termux, which allows me to write code on the go when I am away from my PC (which is slowly becoming more and more often). However, it is not really intended for building since I still am learning how some of these tools work, especially [](ccls).

I am considering shifting to Android development, also with Termux and utilizing [](BuildAPKs), which means that this config might soon work for both Java and C++. Exciting.
